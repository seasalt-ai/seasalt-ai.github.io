The world of Conversational AI is abuzz with innovation. While [Nuance Mix NLU](https://www.nuance.com/omni-channel-customer-engagement/ai-for-developers/nuance-mix.html) has established itself as a powerful tool for understanding user intent, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a compelling alternative. [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform built on LLM technology, offers a glimpse into the potential future of Conversational AI.
