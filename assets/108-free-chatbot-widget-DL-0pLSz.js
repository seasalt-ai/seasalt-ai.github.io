Web chat and chatbot widgets are indispensable tools for businesses looking to engage their website visitors, streamline customer support, and boost conversions. These widgets facilitate real-time communication, provide automated responses from humans or via AI, and integrate with customer management systems to enhance the customer journey. While many free plans offer compelling features, understanding what they include—and where they fall short—can help you make an informed decision.

There are a zillion chatbot or webchat providers on the market. They all come with a free plan, or a free trial. But most have caveats.

We are on a quest to find the truly free options for you – free in cost and free in freedom. Originally we had a long list of 10 tools, but as we dived deeper into the fineprints, we found more gotcha’s. Then we narrowed down the list from 10 to 8, then to 6, and finally to only 2 on the market.

## Common Features of Free Plans

Most free plans for web chat and chatbot widgets come with several standard features that make them suitable for small to medium-sized businesses exploring entry-level solutions:

- **Live Chat Functionality**: All the tools we reviewed provide live chat capabilities, enabling businesses to communicate with visitors directly on their websites.

- **Chat Widgets But Might Not Be Customizable**: The ability to modify widget appearance, including color schemes and text prompts, ensures these tools align with your brand identity.

- **Desktop Apps For Sure, Mobile Apps Maybe**: Support for mobile and desktop apps allows agents to stay connected and respond to customers on the go.

- **Visitor Insights Might Be Limited Or None**: Tools like real-time monitoring and visitor tracking provide businesses with crucial data on who is interacting with their website.

- **CRM Integrations Are Hit or Miss**: Not many free plans integrate with popular CRM tools, allowing businesses to consolidate customer interactions and data in one place.

- **Conversation History Might Be Limited**: Free plans often include limited conversation history, but only a few offer unlimited storage without upgrading.

- **History Download Might Have Paywall**: The freedom to migrate your chat history out of a system is important to some users.

## Common Trade-offs to Expect from Free Plans

Here's what you can generally expect from free plans:

- **Questionable Scalability**: Limited in agents or conversation capacity (e.g., Tidio allows only 50 conversations per month, and Chatwoot caps at 500).

- **Limited Customization and Integrations**: Basic customization and limited CRM or channel integrations are typical. Full multi-channel support often requires a paid plan.

- **Optional Data Retention**: Most free plans limit history retention to 30 days to two months, making them unsuitable for businesses needing long-term access to chat data.

- **Mostly No AI and Automation Features**: Entry-level AI features may be included but that is not usually the case.

Understanding these limitations can help businesses determine whether a free plan meets their needs or if they should invest in a paid solution to unlock critical features.

## Our Definition of “Truly Free” – Free in Price and Freedom to Own Your Data:

Still, there are authentic truly free options on the market. When searching these services, we ask ourselves: are we gonna use them as a business? Does it have a minimal feature set that fits my business’s long term goal? Eventually we come up with the following criteria:

- **At Least One Free Human Agent**: The plan should support at least one live agent for real-time communication.

- **Unlimited Chats** – Businesses must be able to conduct unlimited conversations, ensuring no restrictions on customer engagement.

- **Unlimited Contacts** – There should be no limits on the number of customer contacts businesses can interact with through the platform.

- **Unlimited History**: Free plans should retain all past conversations, allowing businesses to access historical data for insights and compliance.

- **Free to Export Chat Data**: Tools must allow the export of chat data for analysis or documentation purposes, ensuring flexibility in migrating to other platforms if needed.


By these criteria, many tools fail to meet the "truly free" standard. Common pitfalls include limited agent support, caps on monthly conversations, short data retention periods, and restrictions on exporting chat history.

### Key Takeaway

These free plans are great for testing or minimal needs but fall short for growing businesses. Consider them for personal projects or small-scale use, but for long-term, production-level functionality, upgrading may be essential.

## Free Trials vs. Truly Free Plans

Free trials offer a glimpse into premium chat solutions, showcasing advanced scalability, AI capabilities, and robust integrations. However, they differ from "free forever" plans, as they are time-limited and designed to encourage upgrades.

Notable Free Trial Options:

- [Olark](https://www.olark.com/) – Customizable widget with ADA compliance, ideal for accessibility-focused businesses.
- [LiveChat](https://www.livechat.com/) – Premium CRM integration for advanced customer management.
- [Drift](https://www.salesloft.com/welcome-drift) – Conversational sales platform with cutting-edge AI chatbot features.
- [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/live-chat) – Sophisticated messaging and CRM tools for targeted engagement.

While these tools provide omni-channel support, analytics, and AI-driven automation, they prioritize paid subscriptions. Free trials are ideal for short-term exploration but lack the long-term usability of "truly free" solutions.

## Conclusion: Only 2 Truly Free Tools

In conclusion, while many web chat and chatbot widgets offer free plans, only a few truly stand out by providing comprehensive features without hidden costs or limitations. Among these, two options shine the brightest:

[**SeaChat by Seasalt.ai**](https://chat.seasalt.ai/en-us/)

This platform combines AI-driven automation with human interaction, offering versatile chat and voice capabilities for multi-channel engagement. With features like free WhatsApp integration, AI replies, and seamless transitions between AI and live agents, SeaChat is ideal for businesses needing cost-effective, multi-channel communication.

You should use SeaChat if you start with a single-person human agent, but plan to scale with both more live agents, and ChatGPT-powered agents for omnichannel integrations include Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, and Phone Calls.

[**Tawk.to**](https://www.tawk.to/software/live-chat/): 

Known for its scalability, Tawk.to offers unlimited agents and chats for free, making it perfect for growing teams. Its customizable widget, real-time visitor monitoring, and multi-language support make it a robust choice for businesses looking to enhance customer engagement without incurring additional costs.

You should use Tawk.to if you start with more than a single human agent, but plan to scale with more human agents and want to stay free with only human agents for even longer.

These truly free options provide valuable tools for businesses to enhance customer engagement, streamline support, and explore advanced features without breaking the bank. By choosing the right widget, businesses can lay a strong foundation for building lasting customer relationships and achieving long-term success.
