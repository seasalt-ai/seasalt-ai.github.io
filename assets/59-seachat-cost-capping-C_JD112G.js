# Preventing Abuse with SeaChat's Chat Monitoring System

Abuse and irrelevant questions are unavoidable when implementing AI agents for chat interactions. To address this, SeaChat has developed a robust chat monitoring system that allows you to intervene in real-time conversations. This means that even though the AI agent handles most interactions automatically, you have the option to step in and chat with the person when needed.

Imagine you have set up your AI agent to provide customer support. With SeaChat's chat system, you can be actively involved in customer conversations. This ensures that if any inappropriate or abusive language is used, or if the conversation veers off-topic, you can promptly intervene and mitigate the situation.

Moreover, the chat monitoring system also enables you to maintain the quality of interactions and ensure that your AI agent is providing accurate and relevant responses. By monitoring conversations, you can identify any areas of improvement and fine-tune your agent's responses to offer even better customer experiences.

Another common concern for AI agent owners is managing costs effectively. It's essential to stay within your planned budget without unexpected surprises. SeaChat understands this, and to help you overcome the financial worries, they have introduced cost limit alerts.

With cost limit alerts, you can set a budget or usage threshold, and SeaChat will notify you whenever your AI agent's usage approaches or exceeds that limit. This feature empowers you to keep track of your expenses and be notified in real-time if there's an unexpected surge in usage or abuse detected. By receiving timely alerts, you can take proactive measures to address any issues promptly.

So, how exactly do cost limit alerts work? Let's say you have set a monthly usage budget of 1000 chat interactions. Once your AI agent reaches 900 interactions, which is 90%, SeaChat will send you an alert. You can also adjust the alert threshold anytime. This enables you to reevaluate your strategy or implement appropriate measures to ensure you stay within your desired budget. By having control and visibility over your AI agent's usage, you can avoid any unpleasant surprises on your bill.
