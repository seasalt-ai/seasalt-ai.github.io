## 3. **Customization with Knowledge Base Upload**

Businesses often have specific needs and terminologies unique to their domain. SeaChat addresses this by allowing the upload of a knowledge base in various formats (pdf, csv, doc, png, jpg, etc.). This feature enables the AI agent to provide more accurate and relevant responses, tailored to the specific context of the business.
