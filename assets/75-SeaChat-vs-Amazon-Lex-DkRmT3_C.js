The world of chatbots is evolving rapidly. While [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) has been a popular choice for building voice and text interfaces, a new wave of technology is taking center stage: Large Language Models (LLM). [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) is an LLM-powered platform that offers a revolutionary approach to conversational AI, leaving rule-based engines like Lex far behind. Is it time to consider upgrading your chatbot?

## Amazon Lex: The Reliable "Workhorse," But Stuck in Place

Amazon Lex has established itself as the "workhorse" for building chatbots. Its drag-and-drop interface and integration with other AWS services make it a user-friendly choice. Here are some strengths of Lex:

- **Ease of Use**: Visual interface simplifies chatbot creation, minimizing the need for coding expertise.
- **Rapid Deployment**: Lex allows quick development and deployment of chatbots, perfect for fast projects.
- **AWS Integration**: Seamless integration with other AWS services simplifies development within the AWS ecosystem.

However, Lex also has limitations that might hinder your chatbot's capabilities:

- **Scripted Conversations**: Lex relies on predefined intents and utterances, leading to rigid and unnatural conversation flow.
- **Limited NLU**: Understanding complex queries and adapting to context can be challenging for Lex.
- **Scalability Issues**: Performance may decline when handling large volumes of user interactions.

## SeaChat: Charting the Course for Chatbot Future

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, brings a paradigm shift to conversational AI:

- **Conversational Learning**: SeaChat continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions, constantly improving its ability to handle complex queries.
- **Seamless User Experience**: By understanding context and intent, SeaChat promotes more natural conversation flow, mimicking human interactions.

Here's why SeaChat is the future of chatbots:

- **Natural Conversations**: Users crave chatbots that feel like talking to a real person, which is exactly what SeaChat delivers through LLM technology.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Building chatbots with SeaChat requires less coding compared to rule-based engines, saving time and resources.

Research shows that the difference between intent/entity-based NLU and LLM-based NLU is [millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): 630,000 examples versus just 32 for training. This dramatic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings for businesses adopting GenAI/LLM-based NLU.
