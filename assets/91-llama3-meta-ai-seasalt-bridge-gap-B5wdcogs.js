# Meta AI and Llama3
Meta AI has just released Llama 3, and now you can directly chat with Meta’s AI assistant from the search boxes of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It’s also going to start appearing directly in the main Facebook feed. And for the first time, it’s now accessible via a standalone website at Meta.ai. So the experience is very similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot now.

This is big news for the entire AI community because Llama is one of the most powerful open-source large language models available to all now, and its performance is almost comparable to closed-source models like OpenAI’s GPT family and Google’s Gemini. Having Meta AI directly accessible on Meta’s family of social apps will also make talking to AI chatbots easier and more natural for all consumers.

# Why should I care?
You might wonder, “It’s all cool that Meta is releasing more powerful and more accessible AI assistants. But how exactly can I leverage that as a business owner/person?"

This is why [Seasalt.ai](https://seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) exists and continues to develop Conversational AI products like [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) and [SeaMeet](https://seameet.ai/?utm_source=blog) that can solve practical business challenges. As AI technology becomes more powerful, or more precisely, as the large language foundational models become more powerful, we can build better products. Conversational AI is an ecosystem, and you need companies like Seasalt.ai to **bridge the gap between the model and applications**.

Users can now only chat with Meta AI and ChatGPT for fun or use it to complete a simple task, but there’s still a lot to do to actually make it useful for actual business applications. Here are a few things we do to bridge this gap and make these powerful AI assistants actually useful in your life and business:

## Use case focused

At Seasalt.ai, we focus on building Conversational AI products that can solve real business pain points. Whether you want to build [AI customer service agents](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) that can answer questions based on your company policies, or build a company internal knowledge base that can free up time for your employees who answer repetitive questions, or have a [reliable meeting notetaker](https://seameet.ai/?utm_source=blog) that not only promptly shows up at all your meetings, transcribes, and summarizes the meeting as soon as you finish meetings. These are all practical use cases that are loved by our customers. Off-the-shelf AI models from Meta, Google, or OpenAI are intelligent, but they are not focused on your pain points and use cases.

## Customization
You cannot customize off-the-shelf AI models to your needs without extensive development and customization. At Seasalt.ai, we make customization extremely easy for you. You can bring all the documents from your company and build a [chatbot that answers questions based on your documents in 10 minutes](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog). It will take a lot of time for you to gather all meeting transcriptions and customize meeting note templates. We streamline that process for you by offering [topic-based summaries after each of your meetings](https://seameet.ai/?utm_source=blog). The only thing you have to do is attend the meeting and focus on the communication. Off-the-shelf AI models from Meta, Google, or OpenAI are intelligent, but they are not focused on your customization needs.

## Communication Channels

You might have a lot of fragmented conversations with ChatGPT or Meta AI, but you cannot manage these conversations easily. What you really need is to offer your own AI assistants on your customers’ preferred channels, and then you can [manage all the conversations in a central location](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog). SeaChat now integrates with **WhatsApp, Meta Facebook Messenger, LINE, web chats** (including your own websites, Shopify, Squarespace, Wix websites). We offer you a central location to interact with your customers (whether via AI agent or human agents) from all kinds of channels. So you can focus on providing the best customer experience. Meta AI, as well as the other technology giants, cannot and probably will never provide you with omni-channel communication capabilities because inherently they only want people to stay on their communication channels.
