In the era of globalization, the importance of collaboration tools is increasingly prominent, especially in multilingual environments. Google Duet AI, as an advanced collaboration tool, offers a variety of features to improve meeting and collaboration efficiency. However, it currently does not provide Chinese language support, which may cause some inconvenience for Chinese users, especially Traditional Chinese users. Fortunately, there are other collaboration tools, such as [SeaMeet](https://seameet.ai/?utm_source=blog), that can provide effective solutions for Chinese users.

# Advantages of Google Duet AI in Meeting Functions

Google Duet AI is designed to be a tool that can improve meeting efficiency in Google Meet. It provides features such as automatic note-taking and real-time translation subtitles, to ensure smoother and more efficient communication in meetings. For example, through Duet AI's "take notes for me" feature, participants can capture notes and action items in real-time during the meeting, without the need for manual recording. In addition, the real-time translation subtitle feature also provides great help for cross-language communication. However, it is regrettable that Duet AI currently does not provide Chinese, especially Traditional Chinese, support.

With the advancement of globalization, the demand for cross-language collaboration is continuously increasing. The examples of Google Duet AI and SeaMeet show that even with language barriers, effective collaboration can be achieved through the use of appropriate tools and platforms. In the future, we can expect more collaboration tools and platforms to launch new features and language support to meet the needs of global users.

# Choosing the Right Meeting Tool

When choosing a meeting tool, it is important to consider the specific needs and preferences of the team. For teams that require Chinese language support, choosing a product like SeaMeet that provides full Chinese language support is extremely important.

# Conclusion

By comparing Google Duet AI and SeaMeet, we can see that although Duet AI provides some powerful features to improve meeting efficiency, it still has some shortcomings in language support. In contrast, SeaMeet provides Chinese users, especially Traditional Chinese users, with a viable solution to ensure smooth cross-language collaboration. As globalization progresses, choosing a collaboration tool that can meet different language needs will become increasingly important.
