*In this article, we will walk you through Google Business Profile, its chat feature, and a way to avoid missing out on customers' messages.*


One of the best ways your business can stand out is to provide excellent customer service, which includes being available for existing and potential customers whenever they need help and providing up-to-date information about your business. Excellent customer service means greater customer satisfaction, a stellar reputation, and more potential customers. In this article, we will walk you through Google Business Profile and its chat feature that can help you build customer relationships.

Google Business Profile is a tool that enables businesses to create a free business profile or listing that will appear across Google services such as Google Search and Google Maps. You can refer to Google’s resources about [how to add or claim your Business Profile on Google](https://support.google.com/business/answer/2911778?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). The advantage of having a Google Business Profile listing includes:

- Attract customers and gain more visibility through Google Search and Google Maps
- Provide up-to-date information about your business such as business hours and attributes
- Build reputation through star rating and reviews
- Gain insights about your search performance across Google services

However, creating a Google Business Profile is not enough to meet customers’ ever-growing demands. In order to optimize your Google Business Profile listing, you can also activate your Google Business Profile’s chat feature, a free service accessible to your customers straight from your Google Business Profile listing. Did you know that [61% of customers would recommend friends to turn to other businesses with real-time communication](https://blog.avochato.com/index.php/2019/12/12/business-to-customer-communication-text-message-software)?

That is why we think the chat feature is a great way to be available to customers. By enabling a chat feature for your business, you can provide real-time communication that your customers crave. You can refer to Google’s resources on [how the chat feature works](https://support.google.com/business/answer/9114771?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=). You can activate your chat feature in just 3 easy steps below:

### Step 1. Sign in to your Google Business Profile account. 

Visit the [Google Business Profile homepage](https://www.google.com/business/), and sign in to your business listing.

Once you activate the Google Business Profile Messaging service, you can see a Chat button on your listing and customers will be able to reach out to your business with any inquiries they may have. Keep in mind that when you are using this feature, you have to ensure that you will be available to respond to inquiries. Customers can see your average response time and might be discouraged to contact you if they see a longer response time. It is crucial that you reply to your customer messages within 24 hours. According to the Google [Business Profile FAQ page](https://support.google.com/business/answer/9114771?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Chow-do-i-keep-the-chat-button-active-on-google), Google may remove the "Chat" button on your listing if you don’t reply within a day.

But don’t worry, Google gives you another way to notify you when customers message your business through the chat button. Google will send you an email for missed messages. Or as happened to some customers, you can activate the SMS alerts to get notifications of missed messages. According to this article, the SMS alerts used to be the primary messaging feature on Google Business Profile. However, the feature was replaced by the mobile app and web interface. It looks like Google is returning this feature for Google Business Profile. We suggest that once you activate your chat feature, wait for a notification about the new SMS alerts feature to pop up on your phone. In our experience, out of the 5 businesses that we manage, only 2 of them received a notification about this feature.
