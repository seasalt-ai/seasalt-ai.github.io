Incorporating SeaChat‚Äôs WhatsApp AI chatbot into your Wix website not only elevates your customer service but also positions your business at the forefront of technological innovation. Embrace the future of customer engagement with SeaChat.

In today‚Äôs digital landscape, effective customer service and user engagement are critical for businesses to thrive. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), a popular website builder, offers various tools to connect with customers, including Wix Chat. However, for more robust and intelligent interactions, consider integrating SeaChat‚Äîan AI-powered chatbot‚Äîinto your Wix website. Let‚Äôs explore how SeaChat enhances your customer communication.

# Introduction: Wix Chat and WhatsApp

## Wix Chat: A Convenient Option

Wix Chat allows you to manage conversations directly on your website. It‚Äôs a useful tool for engaging with visitors and addressing their queries. However, there‚Äôs a limitation: it lacks the sophistication of an AI agent. While Wix Chat provides real-time communication, you may still need an AI-powered solution to handle customer inquiries 24/7.

# Enter SeaChat: Your AI Assistant
[SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) bridges the gap by offering an AI agent that can seamlessly handle conversations. Whether it‚Äôs answering common questions, providing product information, or assisting with troubleshooting, SeaChat is always available. But here‚Äôs the exciting part: you can integrate SeaChat not only with your webchat widget but also with WhatsApp.

## Use SeaChat as a Webchat Widget on Wix

With SeaChat, you don‚Äôt have to choose between webchat and WhatsApp. You can use SeaChat for both simultaneously. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Create a SeaChat Account**: If you haven‚Äôt already, sign up for a SeaChat account on the [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) website. Build your AI agent to handle various tasks.

</center>

2. **Navigate to Wix Dashboard**: Log in to your Wix dashboard for the relevant website. Click on ‚ÄúDesign Site‚Äù to access the site editor.

</center>

3. **Add Elements**: In the sidebar menu, select ‚ÄúAdd Elements.‚Äù

</center>

4. **Embed SeaChat Code**: Choose ‚ÄúEmbed Code‚Äù and then ‚ÄúEmbed HTML.‚Äù Retrieve the SeaChat code snippet from your workspace (Agent Configuration -> Channels -> Wix channel) and paste it into the code box. Don‚Äôt forget to click ‚ÄúUpdate.‚Äù

</center>

5. Adjust Chat Widget Size: Use the sizing tool to adjust the chat widget‚Äôs dimensions. Drag the widget to your desired location (usually the lower right corner).

</center>

6. Fix SeaChat Widget Location

You will need to fix the widget location so it does not move around when visitors scroll down the page. Select the component > Right-click > Select "Pin to Screen". Then this component will be fixed on the corner and floating.

You can adjust the margin/offset. We recommend 20 for both vertial and horizontal settings.
