## Pricing

### Free Plans

Both platforms offer generous free plans.

- Mailchimp: Up to 500 contacts, 1,000 emails/month (very limited features)
- MailerLite: Up to 1,000 contacts, 12,000 emails/month (with more features)

### Paid Plans
MailerLite generally offers more affordable pricing tiers, especially at lower subscriber counts. Mailchimp's pricing can scale up quickly for larger contact lists.

## Features


- Templates: Mailchimp has a wider selection of pre-designed templates, plus a more advanced template builder. MailerLite provides a solid library of templates with a focus on ease of use.
- Automation: Both have automation builders, but MailerLite's automation is available even on the free plan. Mailchimp's advanced automation features are unlocked on higher-tier plans.
- List Management: MailerLite is often considered easier to use for managing subscribers, creating segments, and organizing your lists.
- A/B Testing: Both platforms support A/B testing of subject lines, content, and send times to help optimization.


## Deliverability

Both companies have strong reputations for deliverability (your emails reaching inboxes). MailerLite emphasizes helping users maintain good sending practices, a factor that directly impacts deliverability.

According to [​​Email Deliverability June 2023](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-deliverability-june-2023/), MailerLite has the best deliverability among all the emailing service products tested, although Mailchimp also performed very well in the deliverability test.

## Analytics & Reporting

Mailchimp: Offers more advanced reporting, comparative data, and deeper insights on campaign performance, particularly on higher-priced plans.

MailerLite: Provides clear, user-friendly reporting of core metrics (opens, clicks, unsubscribes, etc.)

## Customer Support

- Mailchimp: Restricts support to paid plans. Premium plans include phone support.

- MailerLite: Known for excellent 24/7 live chat and email support on all plans, including the free one.

## Integrations
Mailchimp wins here, connecting with a vast number of apps and services. MailerLite has good core integrations but might fall short for very niche needs. After all, MailerLite is a younger product.

## Brand Recognition
Mailchimp is the bigger name. This may be a factor if seeking a tool with immediate name recognition for clients, for instance.
