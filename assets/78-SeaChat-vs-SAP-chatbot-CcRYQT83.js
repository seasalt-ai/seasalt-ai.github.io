The winds of change are blowing in the realm of Conversational AI. While [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap/) has been a popular choice for building enterprise chatbots, a new wave of technology is taking center stage: Large Language Models (LLMs). [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform built on LLM technology, offers a groundbreaking approach, leaving behind the limitations of rule-based engines like SAP Conversational AI.  Ready to set sail for a more engaging chatbot experience?

## SAP Conversational AI: A Workhorse, But Stuck in the Past

SAP Conversational AI has established itself as a workhorse for building chatbots within the SAP ecosystem. Its integration with existing SAP solutions and low-code development environment streamline chatbot creation for SAP users. Here are some of SAP Conversational AI's strengths:

- **SAP Integration**: Seamless integration with other SAP solutions simplifies development for organizations already invested in the SAP ecosystem.
- **Low-Code Development**:  A visual interface allows for building chatbots with minimal coding, making it accessible to a broader range of developers.
- **Multilingual Support**: SAP Conversational AI offers support for multiple languages, potentially expanding your chatbot's reach.

However, SAP Conversational AI also has limitations that can hinder your chatbot's capabilities:

- **Limited NLU**: Understanding complex user queries and adapting to context can be challenging for SAP Conversational AI due to its rule-based engine.
- **Scripted Conversations**: Conversations with chatbots built on SAP Conversational AI can feel rigid and pre-programmed, lacking a natural flow.
- **Potential Vendor Lock-In**: Heavy reliance on SAP integration might limit flexibility and scalability for businesses outside the SAP ecosystem.
