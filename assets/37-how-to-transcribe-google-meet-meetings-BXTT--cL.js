# **The Importance of Real-time Transcription for Google Meet**

With the popularity of remote work and online education, video conferencing tools like Google Meet have become indispensable. Among them, the real-time transcription feature can help participants better understand the meeting content, especially when participants have difficulty hearing clearly due to background noise or other factors. In addition, real-time transcription can also provide support for people with hearing impairments, enabling them to participate in meetings more effectively.

# **Google Meet's Built-in Captioning Feature**

Google Meet provides a built-in real-time captioning feature, allowing users to see what participants are saying during a meeting. This not only helps participants keep up with the meeting progress but also helps them record important information.

To enable this feature, simply find the "Captions CC" button and click it while Google Meet is in progress. While this feature is useful, it also has some limitations, such as it may not be completely accurate, especially with strong accents or when multiple people are speaking at the same time.
