To excel at email marketing, you need the right tools that can save you time and efforts without draining your wallets. Popular email marketing platforms and email marketing software options abound, including industry leaders like HubSpot, MailerLite, Mailchimp, and others. Each offers a unique blend of features, pricing, and automation capabilities. Today, we will compare two popular tools, [Hubspot (Marketing Hub)](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/professional) and [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/) for your considerations.


## Choosing Your Email Marketing Tool

Factors to consider when picking a platform include:

- Features: Do you need robust automation (email marketing automation), CRM integration, and advanced analytics like HubSpot? Or does a streamlined solution focused on newsletters and core campaigns (like MailerLite) suit you better?
- Budget: Explore free email marketing plans, compare paid tiers, and investigate options for bulk email marketing software. Tools like SendGrid or Cliqly might be worth considering.
- Deliverability: Research each platform's reputation for ensuring your emails land in inboxes.
- Ease of Use: A user-friendly interface streamlines your workflow.

Effective email marketing requires more than just the right tool. Here's what matters:

- List building: Grow an engaged email list organically with opt-ins and incentives. Look into email lists for marketing services, but always focus on quality over quantity.
- Segmentation: Personalize content by customer interests or behavior for better engagement.
Compelling subject lines: Boost your open rates with attention-grabbing subject lines.
- A/B Testing: Continuously optimize by experimenting with different elements.
- Strong Content: Provide value, not just sales pitches.
- Mobile optimization: Ensure your emails look great on all devices. Good email marketing product will take care of this for you.
- Metrics: Track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions to measure performance.

## HubSpot Marketing Hub

### Pros

- All-In-One Marketing Platform: HubSpot goes far beyond email marketing. It includes a powerful CRM, landing page builder, blogging tools, SEO features, social media management, and extensive analytics.
- Advanced Automation: Create highly sophisticated automation workflows based on extensive triggers, conditions, lead scoring, and segmentation.
- Integrations: Seamlessly connects with a massive array of sales, marketing, and customer service tools.
- Excellent for Scaling Businesses: HubSpot's features suit businesses looking to grow with an inbound marketing approach.

### Cons

- Cost: HubSpot is significantly more expensive than MailerLite, especially as your contact list grows.
- Complexity: Can have a steep learning curve for those primarily focused on email marketing.
- Deliverability: Hubspot does not have great deliverability compared to other email service products, especially MailerLite

## MailerLite

### Pros

- Ease of Use: A user-friendly drag-and-drop email builder, intuitive navigation, and a focus on core email marketing features make MailerLite easy to get started with.
Affordability: Generous free plan (up to 1,000 subscribers), and paid plans are significantly cheaper than HubSpot.
- Advanced Automation: While not as in-depth as HubSpot's, MailerLite's automation capabilities are still powerful for its price point.
- Strong Deliverability: MailerLite maintains excellent email deliverability rates. According to [​​Email Deliverability June 2023](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-deliverability-june-2023/), MailerLite has the best deliverability among all the emailing service products tested. 

### Cons

- Fewer Marketing Tools: Primarily an email marketing platform, lacking the full array of tools available in HubSpot.
- Limited Integrations: Less extensive integrations compared to HubSpot.

# Choosing the Right Email Marketing Tool

Here's what you need to consider before choosing an email marketing tool. Note that switching between email services can be difficult. Once you've established email templates and automations, migrating to another service can be time-consuming. Therefore, it's wise to conduct thorough research before making a decision.

- Budget: If affordability is a prime concern, MailerLite is a strong value choice.
- Experience: For beginners or those primarily focused on email, MailerLite's simplicity is appealing.
- Business Needs: If you need an all-in-one marketing solution and plan to use advanced automation extensively, HubSpot is worth the investment.
- List Size: The cost difference becomes more significant with larger contact lists. You will want to look into pricing for Hubspot's marketing contacts. It adds up quickly.
