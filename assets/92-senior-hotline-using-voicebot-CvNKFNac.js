As Taiwan transitions into a super-aging society, elderly care faces unprecedented challenges. According to data from the National Development Council, the proportion of the elderly population in Taiwan will approach 20% by 2024, and it is expected to officially enter a super-aging society by 2025. Given this demographic shift, how to effectively provide immediate care, diverse services, and address the issue of labor shortages has become the three major challenges currently facing the long-term care industry.

SeaX + SeaChat is a comprehensive AI voice assistant solution launched by Seasalt.ai, specifically designed to address core issues in the elderly care industry. This system can not only automatically make care calls to seniors and interact with them verbally, but also perform regular care, surveys, and many other functions, comprehensively improving the quality and efficiency of long-term care services. Let's delve deeper into how this innovative solution addresses the challenges of the long-term care industry.

### Immediate Care:

For elderly individuals living alone who require immediate support or dementia patients needing special care, traditional telephone systems often cannot respond in a timely manner. SeaX + SeaChat can make automatic care calls or send messages to seniors, such as using elderly emergency phones or elderly emergency messages, ensuring that seniors receive immediate care and support at all times. Whether it's routine regular care or emergency situations, relevant personnel can be quickly notified.

### Diverse Services:

With the increasing elderly population in Taiwan, providing diversified services has become an urgent need for the long-term care industry. SeaX + SeaChat supports multiple communication channels, including voice calls, text messages, and WhatsApp, and can be integrated into day care center services and emergency rescue systems to achieve personalized remote medical care, emotional companionship, and other diverse services. These functions can effectively reduce the workload of long-term care institutions and ensure that every senior receives personalized care.

### Human Resource Optimization:

Shortage of human resources is another major challenge facing the long-term care industry. Through SeaX + SeaChat, highly repetitive and time-consuming care tasks can be automated, greatly reducing the workload of volunteers and medical staff. In addition, the system's built-in real-time call content analysis function can effectively improve communication efficiency, helping staff better allocate resources and focus on cases that require special attention.

## ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Success Story:

A successful case comes from a national long-term care institution in Singapore. The institution originally faced problems with insufficient manpower and low frequency of care. After adopting the SeaX + SeaChat solution, they achieved the following improvements in the quality of long-term care:

- Care frequency increased from once a year to once a month.
- 24-hour automatic answering to ensure seniors receive a response at any time.
- Automatic tracking of missed calls and unchecked-in cases.
- Annual savings of approximately ten thousand hours of volunteer phone time.
- Volunteers are freed from tedious routine tasks, allowing them to focus on providing more refined services.

This case fully demonstrates the enormous potential of AI voice assistants in the field of elderly care. By providing immediate, personalized care services, SeaX + SeaChat has not only improved the quality and efficiency of long-term care services but also provided an innovative solution to the problem of manpower shortage.

## Future Outlook:

As Taiwan's aging problem becomes increasingly severe, SeaX + SeaChat will play an increasingly important role in elderly care. This system can not only improve the quality and efficiency of services but also address the human resource challenges faced by the long-term care industry. Through technological innovation, we will provide better and more comprehensive care for the elderly on the path to a super-aging society.
