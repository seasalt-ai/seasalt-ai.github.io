With the growing aging population, elderly care institutions worldwide face numerous challenges. Especially concerning regular care and health monitoring, which not only require significant human resources but often lead to the inability to detect potential problems in time due to neglect or delay. This is the challenge faced by a social service agency in Singapore, a partner of Seasalt.ai. The agency conducts annual phone check-ins with thousands of seniors, a process that is cumbersome and difficult to manage effectively. To address this issue, they introduced SeaX, which significantly improved the quality and efficiency of care services through AI technology.

## Challenges in Long-Term Care

### Too Low Frequency of Annual Check-ins:
Traditionally, the agency could only conduct one phone check-in per year with each senior. This frequency is insufficient to quickly detect and address potential health issues or emergencies.

### Pressure on Volunteer Resources:
Each annual check-in requires a significant number of volunteers, with volunteers often having to dedicate nearly a full workday to these tasks. Due to limited resources, service quality is difficult to guarantee.

### Insufficient Follow-up:
In the traditional care model, if a senior misses a call, it is usually very difficult to conduct timely follow-up, which can lead to some potential problems being overlooked.

### Inadequate Personalization of Services:
Since the content of phone check-ins is relatively fixed, it is not possible to provide personalized advice or care based on the specific situation of each senior, resulting in some needs not being fully met.

### Untimely Response to Emergencies:
If a senior encounters an emergency outside of the check-in time, the lack of timely communication channels can lead to delayed processing and increased risks.

## Solution: The SeaX Application

### Increased Care Frequency:
After the introduction of SeaX, the agency increased the frequency of care calls from once a year to once a month. This high frequency of check-ins not only improves the level of elderly care but also allows for earlier detection and addressing of potential problems, ensuring seniors receive more timely care.

### Automated Care Calls:
The SeaX AI voice assistant can automatically conduct care calls, meaning volunteers no longer need to spend a lot of time and effort on repetitive phone check-ins. The AI assistant can automatically connect with thousands of seniors and can conduct surveys as needed to better understand the specific needs of each senior.

### Immediate Follow-up and Callbacks:
If a senior misses a call, SeaX will automatically call back to ensure every senior receives care. At the same time, the system can automatically follow up and correct incomplete surveys and promptly notify relevant personnel for follow-up.

### Personalized Care Plans:
Through AI technology, SeaX can provide personalized care plans based on each senior's health status and living habits, including exclusive health advice and reminders.

### Immediate Emergency Handling:
The SeaX system can automatically notify relevant personnel when a senior encounters an emergency, providing immediate support and assistance, ensuring the senior receives the necessary help at critical moments.

## Results and Impact

Through SeaX, the agency not only significantly improved the quality of care services but also greatly reduced the burden on volunteers, making the entire system more efficient. This case fully demonstrates the immense potential of AI technology in elderly care, providing automated and intelligent care services, allowing more seniors to receive continuous and personalized care.
