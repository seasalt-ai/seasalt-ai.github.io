Taiwan is gradually entering a super-aged society, with the number of seniors living alone continuously increasing. According to NDC data, by 2024 Taiwan's elderly population will approach 20%, officially becoming a super-aged society in 2025. This demographic shift has brought the physical and mental health issues of seniors living alone into focus. Many seniors frequently experience loneliness and worry about the possibility of dying alone at home. These psychological pressures not only affect their quality of life but also pose threats to their physical health.

## Loneliness and Health Issues Among Seniors

Seniors living alone often lack daily social interactions, leading to feelings of loneliness and social isolation. This loneliness not only impacts their mental health but also increases their risk of various diseases. Research shows loneliness may lead to higher rates of hypertension, depression and cardiovascular diseases. Other studies indicate seniors living alone have a 27% higher chance of developing dementia compared to the general population. Additionally, seniors living alone often worry they won't get timely help if an accident occurs at home, further increasing their psychological stress and even raising their risk of dying alone.

To address these issues, SeaX offers a complete AI voice assistant solution specifically designed for seniors living alone, aiming to improve their quality of life and reduce loneliness. Through SeaX's smart care calls, seniors can interact with the system anytime, receive regular AI check-ins, and get immediate support when needed.

### Regular Check-ins and Health Monitoring
SeaX's system can make scheduled care calls to conduct simple health inquiries about sleep patterns, diet, etc. This information is automatically recorded in the system, and any abnormalities trigger immediate alerts to caregivers, ensuring seniors receive timely care and attention.

### Personalized Emotional Support
Using SeaX's AI technology, the system provides personalized conversation content based on each senior's preferences to reduce loneliness. The AI assistant can also share news, music or topics of interest, helping seniors feel companionship and easing their loneliness and anxiety.

### Emergency Response
When emergencies occur at home, SeaX's system can immediately notify family members or emergency contacts, and automatically make help calls as needed, ensuring seniors get necessary assistance promptly and reducing health risks associated with isolation.

## Case Study: Successful Application of Care Calls

A social service organization in Singapore significantly improved its senior care services after implementing SeaX's system. Previously conducting annual care calls with thousands of seniors through cumbersome manual processes, the organization struggled with efficiency. After adopting SeaX, call frequency increased from annually to monthly, greatly improving care quality and seniors' quality of life. The AI voice assistant not only automates outbound care calls but also conducts surveys and health monitoring tailored to each senior's needs.
SeaX helped the organization reduce volunteer workloads, allowing them to focus on more meaningful care work. The system also enables real-time tracking of seniors' health conditions, ensuring everyone receives timely care and support.

## Conclusion
The loneliness and health issues of seniors living alone are challenges society cannot ignore. Through SeaX's smart care call solution, we can provide regular health monitoring and emotional support, plus emergency assistance when needed, helping seniors feel safe and cared for at home.
