The world of chatbots is evolving at breakneck speed. While Meta/Facebook’s [wit.ai](http://wit.ai) has served as a stepping stone for building voice-powered applications, a new wave of technology is taking center stage: Large Language Models (LLMs).  [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog), a platform built on LLM technology, offers a groundbreaking approach to Conversational AI, leaving intent-based engines like wit.ai behind.  Is it time to consider an upgrade for your chatbot?

### wit.ai: A Simple Entry Point, But Limited in Scope

wit.ai has established itself as a user-friendly platform for building basic voice interfaces.  Its focus on intent recognition allows developers to get started quickly, particularly for simple applications. 

Here are some of wit.ai's strengths:

- **Accessibility**: The straightforward interface simplifies the creation of basic voice interfaces, making it a good option for beginners or small-scale projects.
- **Focus on Intent Recognition**: Extracting user intent from spoken language is core to wit.ai's functionality. This can be helpful for tasks requiring simple user input.
- **Free Tier**: wit.ai offers a free tier, making it an attractive option for developers on a budget or experimenting with voice applications.

However, as your chatbot project grows in complexity, wit.ai's limitations become apparent:

- **Limited Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Understanding the nuances of human language and context is beyond wit.ai's capabilities. This leads to a stilted and unnatural conversation flow.
- **Scripted Interactions**: wit.ai primarily relies on predefined intents, forcing conversations down a rigid path. This fails to capture the dynamic nature of spoken language.
- **Scalability Concerns**: Performance may decline when handling high volumes of user interactions, hindering growth potential.

## SeaChat: Charting a Course for the Future of Conversational AI

SeaChat, powered by LLM technology, offers a dramatic leap forward in Conversational AI, leaving wit.ai's limitations in the dust:
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: SeaChat excels at comprehending the subtleties of human language, enabling it to hold natural and context-driven conversations.
- **Conversational Learning**: SeaChat continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions, constantly improving its ability to handle complex queries.
- **Seamless User Experience**: By understanding context and intent, SeaChat fosters a more natural flow of conversation, mimicking human interaction.

Study has shown the difference of intent/entity based NLU vs. LLM-based NLU is [in the millions](https://seasalt.ai/blog/73-intent-entity-based-nlu-vs-genai-llm-based-nlu/?utm_source=blog): in terms of training examples, it’s 630,000 examples versus a mere 32. This dramatic reduction in training data requirements translates to significant cost savings for businesses adopting GenAI/LLM-based NLU.

## Setting Sail for a More Engaging Chat Experience
The future of Conversational AI lies in natural, engaging interactions. While wit.ai has served its purpose as a basic voice interface builder, SeaChat offers a revolutionary approach powered by LLMs.  Consider upgrading your chatbot to [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) for a more dynamic and human-like experience.
