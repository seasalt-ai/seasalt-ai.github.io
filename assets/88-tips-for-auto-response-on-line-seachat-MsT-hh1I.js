# What is LINE Auto-Reply?

Want to make LINE your brand's super assistant? When customers are increasing, and one person can't handle it all, it's impossible to respond to every customer one by one. The ["auto-reply bot"](https://line-tw-official.weblog.to/archives/85582088.html) launched by LINE seems to be able to solve this annoying problem! Whether it's welcoming new friends or answering keywords, it seems much easier, right?

However, setting up keyword replies seems to be an ongoing process, and the response patterns are relatively fixed, which may make communication seem a bit monotonous. Such fixed response patterns may sometimes be unsatisfactory, and poor settings can make customers feel a bit distant from the brand, like being separated by a glass pane. Although LINE's auto-reply makes things easier, it lacks flexibility and cannot fully understand the customer's specific problem, only responding to specific keywords, which is a small challenge.

# What! LINE's Auto-Response Message Function Will Cease Service!

In this era of booming AI technology, it's a bit regrettable that [LINE's AI auto-reply function](https://tw.linebiz.com/manual/line-official-account/oa-manager-smartchat/#:~:text=AI%20%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E8%A8%8A%E6%81%AF%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%EF%BC%8C%E9%A0%90%E8%A8%88%E5%B0%87%E6%96%BC2024%20%E5%B9%B4,%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E8%A8%8A%E6%81%AF%E7%9A%84%E9%97%9C%E9%8D%B5%E5%AD%97%E3%80%82) will cease service in May 2024. Everyone might be wondering if there's any tool that can provide warm replies and intelligently help answer customer questions like a little partner?

## How do I integrate LINE's automated responses?

You can define SeaChat as a platform for providing professional information, while LINE is primarily used to trigger keyword-related activities and send media messages, such as coupons, card messages, and videos. By combining the functions of both, you can effectively enhance the user experience and strengthen interaction with customers.

1. Set LINE response settings to manual chat + auto-response.

2. To prevent LINE from repeatedly responding with duplicate messages, please change LINE's auto-response to keyword response. Go to [LINE Business](https://manager.line.biz/) > Auto-response messages > Click on keyword response.

3. Add your desired keywords to the keyword response and complete the message settings. For example, business hours keywords can be: business hours, open, opening hours, etc. And fill in the message settings: "Service hours: Monday to Friday, office hours: 8:00-17:00, lunch break: 12:00-13:00".
