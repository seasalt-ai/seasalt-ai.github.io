## Why is it sometimes necessary to transfer AI bots to live agents?
Although AI bots play an important role in customer service, transferring to live agents is sometimes still necessary. Here are some scenarios and reasons:

- Complex problems: Some problems may exceed the capabilities of AI bots, especially those involving specific domain knowledge or high complexity. Live agents have more knowledge and experience and can better handle these situations.

- Emotional support: When customers face emotional issues, such as complaints, concerns, or emotional problems, live agents can provide more emotional support, build emotional connections, and provide appropriate solutions.

- Special circumstances: Some situations may require human judgment and handling, such as emergencies, dispute resolution, or special circumstances of customer needs. Live agents have the flexibility to respond to various situations.

- Language and cultural differences: For multilingual or multicultural customers, live agents can better handle language and cultural differences, ensuring smooth communication and respecting customer culture. Although AI bots can communicate with customers in multiple languages, when encountering less common languages or customers who are not accustomed to chatting with AI bots, live agents can be used to assist.

In summary, although AI bots excel at providing fast and efficient customer service, live agents still have irreplaceable value in handling specific situations and providing emotional support. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to transfer AI bots to live agents to ensure customers receive the best support experience.
