## Step 1: Defining Your AI Agent's Purpose and Personality

Okay, time to put on your creative hat. Before getting all techy, you need to decide why you're bringing this chatbot to life and who it's going to be. Think about the types of questions it should handle, whether it should be formal or casual, and how it fits with your biz's vibe. This way, your agent becomes an extension of your brand, ready to kick customer service challenges out of the park.

## Step 2: Choosing an AI Voice Bot Platform

Now, you need to find the right platform to create your AI voice agent chatbot. [SeaChat](https://chat.seasalt.ai/?utm_source=blog) by Seasalt.ai is a great, economic option for text and voice AI agent. However, there are other options too if you look around. Take a look at how easy they are to use, if they work well with your systems, what they cost, and the support they provide. Pick the superhero platform that suits your biz's needs and budget.

## Step 3: Designing and Training Your AI Agent

Now, it's showtime! Once you've picked your platform, it's time to design and train your AI agent. Take SeaChat as an example: we have many use cases to choose from: appointment booking, AI gatekeeper for screening calls, customer support, and even product recommender. The agent is very easy to customize on the platform. You can also pick from a range of voices and select a voice that fits your business identity. You can adjust the AI's answer as needed using the review system.

## Step 4: Integrating with a 24x7 Phone System

To take your customer service to legendary levels, you gotta hook up your AI voice agent with a 24x7 phone system. This way, customers can reach that amazing chatbot through phone calls, even when your biz is closed. You can buy a phone number directly on SeaChat at $2.15/month.
