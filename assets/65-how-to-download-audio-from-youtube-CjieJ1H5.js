# Convert Individual YouTube Videos to MP3 (Individual Files)

If it's just a few individual files, I prefer using free online converters. There are many options available. Here are a couple to consider:

## [ToMP3.cc](https://tomp3.cc/)

# Convert Many YouTube Videos to MP3 (A List of Files)

Now, if you have to download a large list of audio files and are open to getting your hands dirty, we should use the command-line tool called \`youtube-dl\`. To be precise, we will actually use its forked version called \`yt-dlp\`.  You can find the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) here: [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## How to Download YouTube Videos as MP3 using \`yt-dlp\`

\`yt-dlp\` is a free tool that you run from your computer's command prompt. It's mostly made using Python and works on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

### Step 1: Installation
Installing \`yt-dlp\` is straightforward. You can download the right files for your computer's system, like Windows or Mac, and then set it up to work. After that, it's ready to go.

Another way to install it is by using a program called \`pip\`. This method lets you get yt-dlp and any updates easily. Here's a simple command you can use:

\`\`\`
python3 -m pip install --no-deps -U yt-dlp
\`\`\`

You might also want to update your certificate and \`yt-dlp\` by running the following:
\`\`\`
python3 -m pip install --upgrade certifi
yt-dlp -U
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Test Installation
After installing, make sure to put the program's location into your computer's PATH so it's easy to find when you use the command prompt.

To test your installation, type:

\`\`\`
yt-dlp --help
\`\`\`

This command prints out general options when using the command-line tool \`yt-dlp\`. 


### Step 3: Download a YouTube Video as MP3

Now, suppose we are going to download a YouTube file https://youtu.be/Qmkd8ucEVbU, we can run the following command:

\`\`\`
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 https://youtu.be/Qmkd8ucEVbU
\`\`\` 

In the above command, the option \`-x\` indicates that we will extract audio only (ignore video), the option \`--audio-format mp3\` specifies the audio format as MP3, and https://youtu.be/Qmkd8ucEVbU is the YouTube file to be downloaded. 

If you want to save the downloaded audio to a specific file name instead of using a name generated by the tool, you can run:
\`\`\`
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 -o Jeremy_Blake_Stardrive_Rock.mp3 https://youtu.be/Qmkd8ucEVbU
\`\`\`

Here, \`-o Jeremy_Blake_Stardrive_Rock.mp3\` indicates that the downloaded file should be saved as \`Jeremy_Blake_Stardrive_Rock.mp3\`.

### Step 4: (Advanced) Download a List of YouTube Videos as MP3

Now we are ready to download a large list of YouTube files. The idea is to write a script to wrap the command-line tool \`yt-dlp\` and then download the files one by one automatically. Let’s use Python.

Copy and paste the following code into a file, maybe we can call it \`download_youtube_to_mp3.py\`. Also, create a file called \`urls.txt\` in the same folder, and add the URLs of the YouTube videos you want to download, with each URL on a separate line. 

\`\`\`
import subprocess

def download_youtube_audios(urls_file):
    with open(urls_file, 'r') as file:
        urls = file.readlines()
        for url in urls:
            url = url.strip()
            subprocess.call(['yt-dlp', '-x', '--audio-format', 'mp3', url])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    urls_file = 'urls.txt'  # Name of the file containing YouTube video URLs
    download_youtube_audios(urls_file)
\`\`\`

Run \`python3 download_youtube_to_mp3.py\` and then you get all the MP3 files from the list of YouTube videos. Voila!


## Legal Considerations 
YouTube has one of the best audio collections, but it’s important to understand the legal terms and make sure that the data you are downloading can be legally used for personal and commercial purposes. Things that you'll have to pay attention to include:

- Copyright: Most content is protected by copyright, requiring permission for use. 
- Creative Commons: Some content has Creative Commons licenses, allowing specific uses without permission. 
- Fair Use: Fair use permits certain uses of copyrighted material, but understanding its application can be complex. 
- YouTube's Terms of Service: Abiding by YouTube's rules is essential to avoid penalties such as account suspension.

Overall, while YouTube offers valuable audio resources, it's vital to use them responsibly and in accordance with legal guidelines. Always ensure you have the appropriate permissions before downloading or using audio content from YouTube.
