Calls that are not received or attended to create critical gaps in patient servicing and care. The &lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong> provides a better oversight need by facilitating access to inbound call data and resolving care facility inadequacies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calls that come from patients, departments, or outside providers are frequently left unchecked in many hospitals and pose multiple risks for patient inquiries, emergency coordination, and compliance standards that the facility needs to adhere to. The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> helps &lt;strong>reduce unmonitored calls in hospitals&lt;/strong>, therefore meeting the objectives of improving operational workflows as well as communication quality within the hospital.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
