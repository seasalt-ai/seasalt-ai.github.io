Well, with the increasing population, the need for help in assisted living centers is increasing day by day. According to the WHO, there will be more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1">two billion people aged over sixty by 2050&lt;/a>. This stat is almost twice as many as in 2020. One of the biggest challenges is having enough staff available to cater to residents.&lt;br>
Studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/us-has-hit-a-wall-reducing-worker-burnout-survey-finds.html">83% of workers in senior care facilities&lt;/a> suffer from burnout. This is primarily caused by overwork and negative staff-to-resident ratios. This severely impacts response time and quality of care. For overcoming this challenge, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a> provides continuous support in Assisted Living.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Routine Outreach Redefined: How Voice AI Delivers Consistent Care for Seniors</title><link>/blog/47-routine-outreach-redefined-how-voice-ai-delivers-consistent-care-for-seniors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/47-routine-outreach-redefined-how-voice-ai-delivers-consistent-care-for-seniors/</guid><description>&lt;p>The growing senior population tends to experience significant isolation as their health fluctuates, making it challenging for them to engage with the rest of the world. This need for connection is why they require consistent and personalized care. Why can’t health workers rely on traditional outreach methods? The reason is that these outdated methods are not sufficiently advanced to meet this need, resulting in gaps in their communication and overall well-being. Therefore, Voice AI and particularly &lt;a href="https://seax.seasalt.ai/">&lt;strong>SeaX&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>Voice AI&lt;/strong> are here as a transformative remedy, promising to offer 24/7 and empathetic interaction. Technology plays a crucial role in automating routine check-ins and personalized reminders, making sure that every senior citizen receives prompt support, establishing a sense of connection, and boosting the overall consistency of the care, which was impossible due to mainstream measures.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
