&lt;p>Elders don&amp;rsquo;t just need medical care – they need human interaction. There are literally countless research studies revealing older persons thrive with frequent, warm, friendly interaction with others who show an honest interest in their health. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240029200">World Health Organization&lt;/a> identifies social loneliness as a major cause of early death, with risks similar to those of either smoking or obesity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Routine Outreach Redefined: How Voice AI Delivers Consistent Care for Seniors</title><link>/blog/47-routine-outreach-redefined-how-voice-ai-delivers-consistent-care-for-seniors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/47-routine-outreach-redefined-how-voice-ai-delivers-consistent-care-for-seniors/</guid><description>&lt;p>The growing senior population tends to experience significant isolation as their health fluctuates, making it challenging for them to engage with the rest of the world. This need for connection is why they require consistent and personalized care. Why can’t health workers rely on traditional outreach methods? The reason is that these outdated methods are not sufficiently advanced to meet this need, resulting in gaps in their communication and overall well-being. Therefore, Voice AI and particularly &lt;a href="https://seax.seasalt.ai/">&lt;strong>SeaX&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>Voice AI&lt;/strong> are here as a transformative remedy, promising to offer 24/7 and empathetic interaction. Technology plays a crucial role in automating routine check-ins and personalized reminders, making sure that every senior citizen receives prompt support, establishing a sense of connection, and boosting the overall consistency of the care, which was impossible due to mainstream measures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leverage Voice AI and AI Messaging for Hospital Pre-Visit and Follow Up Instruction, Reminders and Notifications</title><link>/blog/08-leverage-voice-ai-and-ai-messaging-for-hospital-pre-visit-and-follow-up-instruction-reminders-and-notifications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/08-leverage-voice-ai-and-ai-messaging-for-hospital-pre-visit-and-follow-up-instruction-reminders-and-notifications/</guid><description>&lt;p>Clear patient communication is a critical aspect of every step in the healthcare process, ranging from appointment scheduling to treatment compliance and follow up care.

Patients expect immediate responses, scheduling, and information, yet many call centers struggle with holding times and staff overwork. There is an urgent need for smarter and scalable solutions to address this demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike human agents, AI does not need to rest, so patients can receive support whenever they need it. AI can transform how patients communicate with a healthcare provider by using &lt;strong>AI-powered voice agents for healthcare,&lt;/strong> call centers are capable of scheduling appointments, providing assistance, and answering basic questions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
