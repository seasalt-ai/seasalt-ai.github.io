Since our scaly, furry, and feathered patients cannot tell us their symptoms, information transfer is essential to providing the best possible health. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> revolutionizes how this information passes through veterinary practices, ensuring nothing important is missed when pets’ well-being is at stake.&lt;/p>
