However, problems such as missed calls, and delayed responses result in frustrating the client and compromising pet care. The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard)">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> included in &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">SeaHealth&lt;/a> is an AI tool that takes the lead as a powerful solution, assisting vets to capture every single pet owner call, boosting efficiency without testing their patience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="https://devonshire-digital-marketing-agency.odoo.com/blog/our-blog-1/stop-losing-clients-to-missed-calls-a-guide-for-veterinary-clinics-65">Devonshire Digital Marketing Agency&lt;/a>, 80% of callers wonâ€™t leave voicemails and will eventually contact another clinic if their call is not picked up on time. AI technology lets vets finally stop doing tasks such as manually updating medical records and get to spend more time with furry patients, according to &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/artificial-intelligence-poised-transform-veterinary-care">AVMA&lt;/a>. According to &lt;a href="https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/veterinary-medicine-2025/">Veterinary Practice News&lt;/a>, their vets have reported increased client understanding and satisfaction after using AI-driven tools.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
