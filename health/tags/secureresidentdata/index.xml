With 24-hour care requirements, diverse resident identities, and intricate care needs, your facility navigates a communication landscape full of potential pitfalls. New technologies such as &lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong> are only just beginning to appear to confront your potential problems head-on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
