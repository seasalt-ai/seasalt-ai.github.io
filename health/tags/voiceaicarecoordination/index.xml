When you have effective flow of information among caregivers, residents and facilities, clinical outcomes are significantly impacted. But when communication is poor, outcomes are anywhere between the inconsequential to the fatal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LTC facilities are plagued with communication problems unlike those found in other healthcare dispensations. With 24-hour care requirements, diverse resident identities, and intricate care needs, your facility navigates a communication landscape full of potential pitfalls. New technologies such as &lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong> are only just beginning to appear to confront your potential problems head-on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond the Crisis: Outbound Initiatives for Post-Emergency Follow-Up</title><link>/blog/22-beyond-the-crisis-outbound-initiatives-for-post-emergency-follow-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/22-beyond-the-crisis-outbound-initiatives-for-post-emergency-follow-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>After a hospital visit, Patients can feel alone. &lt;strong>Post emergency care voice AI&lt;/strong> helps them feel supported. Follow-up calls remind patients to take their medications, track symptoms, and prevent relapses. Without this support, one in five patients returns to the hospital within a month, which clinics cannot ignore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nurses handle too many patients. They may miss calls, and families can get confused by instructions. Manual tracking often misses warning signs. This leads to unnecessary readmissions, higher costs and unhappy patients.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
