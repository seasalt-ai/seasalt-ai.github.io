Call handling by answering services has been the norm for a long time, but most of them are expensive, inconsistent, and have lag times during busy periods. Due to increasing pressures in long-term care, facilities need a better value communication system that is dependable.&lt;/p>

Patient satisfaction is the key to success. The ringing of a phone is not background noise. The patient is trying to make an appointment. If no one answers, they won’t wait. They will call a different clinic. It&amp;rsquo;s a lost trade. Dental clinics that use &lt;strong>AI call management for dental clinics&lt;/strong> eliminate this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every missed call delays treatment, annoys patients, or leaves a chair empty. Front desk teams handle calls, paperwork, and in-person visitors. It&amp;rsquo;s simple to ignore a call. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>helps dental clinics reduce missed calls&lt;/strong> by answering, scheduling, and handling patient questions. Workers can focus on treating patients in the office.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
