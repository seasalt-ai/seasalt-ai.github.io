Why? Because its &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a> component is considered a time and cost-saver. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aaha.org/trends-magazine/trends-may-2024/applications-of-ai-in-veterinary-practice/">American Animal Hospital Association,&lt;/a> AI-assisted technology can also save veterinarians precious time. The time saved can be redirected towards other various aspects of patient care that demand the vet’s expertise. One area where AI is revolutionising vet practices is in boosting operational efficiency, something that connects deeply with their profession.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How SeaHealth Voice AI Improves Front Desk Operations at Animal Hospitals</title><link>/blog/44-how-seahealth-voice-ai-improves-front-desk-operations-at-animal-hospitals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/44-how-seahealth-voice-ai-improves-front-desk-operations-at-animal-hospitals/</guid><description>&lt;p>Managing the front desk services at an animal hospital can be very demanding. The front desk staff deal with never ending calls, numerous appointments to be made, and several queries from clients. All these, if not handled properly, can cause great distress to the staff, not only does this make the operations ineffective, but the pets also do not get the standard of care they deserve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An overwhelming number of calls, attending to emergencies, and &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/blog/seachat-voice-ai-agent-for-appointment-booking/">setting appointments&lt;/a> is a recipe for staff burnout which results in unsatisfactory customer care &lt;strong>. SeaHealth&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Voice AI for animal hospitals&lt;/strong> solves these problems through automation of front desk tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Outbound Communication for Pet Care: Pre-Visit Instructions &amp; Regular Check-Ins</title><link>/blog/43-enhanced-outbound-communication-for-pet-care-pre-visit-instructions-regular-check-ins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/43-enhanced-outbound-communication-for-pet-care-pre-visit-instructions-regular-check-ins/</guid><description>&lt;p>The veterinary clinic staff is often actively indulged in various client-facing communication tasks, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Communicating diagnosis and treatment plans with clients&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Educating clients on preventive care and pet health management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide clear post-treatment instructions and follow-up guidance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Handle appointments, billing, and concerns professionally and respectfully&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All these mentioned tasks are a crucial part of vet clinics for maintaining trust, loyalty, and long-term client retention. An effective “To and From” structured &lt;a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02558-2">communication strategy&lt;/a> is necessary to keep the various vet care operations running smoothly (especially before and after the scheduling period), while also delivering a smooth client experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
