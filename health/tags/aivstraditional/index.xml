Call handling by answering services has been the norm for a long time, but most of them are expensive, inconsistent, and have lag times during busy periods. Due to increasing pressures in long-term care, facilities need a better value communication system that is dependable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of technological improvements, &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>Voice AI&lt;/strong> is changing communication in long-term care by offering &lt;strong>cost benefits in residential care&lt;/strong> homes. Unlike regular answering services, AI-based solutions have automation, instant answer delivery, and &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/blog/98-inbound-answering-automated-system/">round-the-clock availability&lt;/a>. This means that caregivers, residents, and their families are not unduly delayed or neglected and get proper support.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
