&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Communicating diagnosis and treatment plans with clients&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Educating clients on preventive care and pet health management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide clear post-treatment instructions and follow-up guidance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Handle appointments, billing, and concerns professionally and respectfully&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All these mentioned tasks are a crucial part of vet clinics for maintaining trust, loyalty, and long-term client retention. An effective “To and From” structured &lt;a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02558-2">communication strategy&lt;/a> is necessary to keep the various vet care operations running smoothly (especially before and after the scheduling period), while also delivering a smooth client experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keeping Pet Owners Connected 24/7: The Role of SeaChat Voice AI in Veterinary Clinics</title><link>/blog/41-keeping-pet-owners-connected-247-the-role-of-seachat-voice-ai-in-veterinary-clinics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/41-keeping-pet-owners-connected-247-the-role-of-seachat-voice-ai-in-veterinary-clinics/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is no denying that the healthcare industry is benefitting hugely from digitally powered solutions (especially in customer services), be it for scheduling appointments, medicine follow-ups, or quick doctor-patient assistance. A similar demand is increasing for the veterinary sector, due to its natural requirement of continuous communication between pet owners and veterinary clinics.​&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many bottlenecks caused by inefficient communications in veterinary clinics, such as increased clinical workload, delayed pert care, or miscommunications in general. Let’s uncover some key challenges faced by traditional veterinary communication and see how &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a>, an innovative AI-powered solution for enhancing client engagement, significantly tackles them. ​&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Capturing Every Pet Owner Call: SeaMeet Dashboard in Veterinary Settings</title><link>/blog/40-capturing-every-pet-owner-call-seameet-dashboard-in-veterinary-settings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/40-capturing-every-pet-owner-call-seameet-dashboard-in-veterinary-settings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Effective communication is a valuable asset in every business sector, including veterinary practices, creating and nurturing pet health. However, problems such as missed calls, and delayed responses result in frustrating the client and compromising pet care. The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard)">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> included in &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">SeaHealth&lt;/a> is an AI tool that takes the lead as a powerful solution, assisting vets to capture every single pet owner call, boosting efficiency without testing their patience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="https://devonshire-digital-marketing-agency.odoo.com/blog/our-blog-1/stop-losing-clients-to-missed-calls-a-guide-for-veterinary-clinics-65">Devonshire Digital Marketing Agency&lt;/a>, 80% of callers won’t leave voicemails and will eventually contact another clinic if their call is not picked up on time. AI technology lets vets finally stop doing tasks such as manually updating medical records and get to spend more time with furry patients, according to &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/artificial-intelligence-poised-transform-veterinary-care">AVMA&lt;/a>. According to &lt;a href="https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/veterinary-medicine-2025/">Veterinary Practice News&lt;/a>, their vets have reported increased client understanding and satisfaction after using AI-driven tools.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
