By 2050, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health">estimates suggest&lt;/a> that the proportion of people over 60 years old will approach doubling from 12% to 22%, now that this demographic is evolving.

Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">&lt;strong>SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> is on the rise as an invaluable tool to help professional caregivers and families more effectively provide more humane elder care. This shows &lt;strong>how Voice AI improves service and caregivers&amp;rsquo; satisfaction in elder care&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
