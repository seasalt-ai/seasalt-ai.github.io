The front desk staff deal with never ending calls, numerous appointments to be made, and several queries from clients. All these, if not handled properly, can cause great distress to the staff, not only does this make the operations ineffective, but the pets also do not get the standard of care they deserve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An overwhelming number of calls, attending to emergencies, and &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/blog/seachat-voice-ai-agent-for-appointment-booking/">setting appointments&lt;/a> is a recipe for staff burnout which results in unsatisfactory customer care &lt;strong>.
