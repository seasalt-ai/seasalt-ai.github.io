Good scheduling makes sure doctors and nurses are ready to help when needed. But sometimes, too many patients or not enough staff can cause problems and delay care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Old scheduling methods can’t keep up with sudden busy times. When there are many emergency cases, there might not be enough doctors. Nurses may have to leave their other jobs to help, which can create gaps in care. Manual rescheduling takes a lot of time and can put lives at risk. This is where &lt;strong>AI-driven emergency scheduling&lt;/strong> adapted in real time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ensuring Every Emergency Care Call Answered: SeaMeet Dashboard in Action</title><link>/blog/19-ensuring-every-emergency-care-call-answered-seameet-dashboard-in-action/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/19-ensuring-every-emergency-care-call-answered-seameet-dashboard-in-action/</guid><description>&lt;p>In emergency care, every second matters.
