Patient satisfaction is the key to success. The ringing of a phone is not background noise. The patient is trying to make an appointment. If no one answers, they won’t wait. They will call a different clinic. It&amp;rsquo;s a lost trade. Dental clinics that use &lt;strong>AI call management for dental clinics&lt;/strong> eliminate this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every missed call delays treatment, annoys patients, or leaves a chair empty. Front desk teams handle calls, paperwork, and in-person visitors. It&amp;rsquo;s simple to ignore a call. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>helps dental clinics reduce missed calls&lt;/strong> by answering, scheduling, and handling patient questions. Workers can focus on treating patients in the office.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smart Scheduling in Hospitals: After-Hours Appointments and Predictive Analytics</title><link>/blog/07-smart-scheduling-in-hospitals-after-hours-appointments-and-predictive-analytics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/07-smart-scheduling-in-hospitals-after-hours-appointments-and-predictive-analytics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the healthcare environment today is so time-constrained, hospitals are increasingly being asked to deliver care beyond traditional hours while optimizing the use of scarce resources.
