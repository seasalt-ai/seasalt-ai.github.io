Well, with the increasing population, the need for help in assisted living centers is increasing day by day. According to the WHO, there will be more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1">two billion people aged over sixty by 2050&lt;/a>. This stat is almost twice as many as in 2020. One of the biggest challenges is having enough staff available to cater to residents.&lt;br>
Studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/us-has-hit-a-wall-reducing-worker-burnout-survey-finds.html">83% of workers in senior care facilities&lt;/a> suffer from burnout. This is primarily caused by overwork and negative staff-to-resident ratios. This severely impacts response time and quality of care. For overcoming this challenge, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a> provides continuous support in Assisted Living.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
