Patient satisfaction is the key to success. The ringing of a phone is not background noise. The patient is trying to make an appointment. If no one answers, they won’t wait. They will call a different clinic. It&amp;rsquo;s a lost trade. Dental clinics that use &lt;strong>AI call management for dental clinics&lt;/strong> eliminate this problem.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s simple to ignore a call. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>helps dental clinics reduce missed calls&lt;/strong> by answering, scheduling, and handling patient questions. Workers can focus on treating patients in the office.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SeaMeet Dashboard for Dental Front Offices: Capturing Every Inquiry</title><link>/blog/11-seameet-dashboard-for-dental-front-offices-capturing-every-inquiry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/11-seameet-dashboard-for-dental-front-offices-capturing-every-inquiry/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="why-is-effective-communication-essential-in-dental-practices">Why Is Effective Communication Essential in Dental Practices?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>It can be overwhelming trying to manage a high volume of patient inquiries. This means receptionists tend to lose untracked inquiries and incident management of patient concerns in the worst-case scenario. If they fail to answer a call, a clinic might be losing potential and existing patients&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
