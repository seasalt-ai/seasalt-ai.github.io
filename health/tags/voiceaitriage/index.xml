Due to this, maintaining the budget can be very challenging with a traditional model. Many elements, including staffing, training, maintaining infrastructure, and much more, may lead to inefficiencies. Instead, &lt;strong>Voice AI reduces emergency response costs&lt;/strong> and enhances efficiency.&lt;/p>
