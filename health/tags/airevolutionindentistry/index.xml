Patient satisfaction is the key to success. The ringing of a phone is not background noise. The patient is trying to make an appointment. If no one answers, they won’t wait. They will call a different clinic. It&amp;rsquo;s a lost trade. Dental clinics that use &lt;strong>AI call management for dental clinics&lt;/strong> eliminate this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every missed call delays treatment, annoys patients, or leaves a chair empty. Front desk teams handle calls, paperwork, and in-person visitors. It&amp;rsquo;s simple to ignore a call. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>helps dental clinics reduce missed calls&lt;/strong> by answering, scheduling, and handling patient questions. Workers can focus on treating patients in the office.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How SeaChat Voice AI Offers 24/7 Dental Support for Inbound Calls</title><link>/blog/12-how-seachat-voice-ai-offers-247-dental-support-for-inbound-calls/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/12-how-seachat-voice-ai-offers-247-dental-support-for-inbound-calls/</guid><description>&lt;p>Currently, we are growing in population rapidly, with a projected population increase of approximately &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population">2 billion&lt;/a> people in the upcoming 30 years. This massive increase comes with an influx of patients. The growing population is more prone to getting dental issues, which means more inbound calls to dental offices for appointments, inquiries, and emergencies. However, such a flood of call after call is challenging for front desk staff to manage, leading to missed opportunities and longer waiting periods for patients.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
