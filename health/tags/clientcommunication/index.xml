&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Communicating diagnosis and treatment plans with clients&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Educating clients on preventive care and pet health management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide clear post-treatment instructions and follow-up guidance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Handle appointments, billing, and concerns professionally and respectfully&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
