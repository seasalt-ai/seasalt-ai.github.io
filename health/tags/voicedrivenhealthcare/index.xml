Calls that are not received or attended to create critical gaps in patient servicing and care. The &lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong> provides a better oversight need by facilitating access to inbound call data and resolving care facility inadequacies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calls that come from patients, departments, or outside providers are frequently left unchecked in many hospitals and pose multiple risks for patient inquiries, emergency coordination, and compliance standards that the facility needs to adhere to. The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> helps &lt;strong>reduce unmonitored calls in hospitals&lt;/strong>, therefore meeting the objectives of improving operational workflows as well as communication quality within the hospital.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Smart Decision: The Many Benefits of SeaHealth Voice AI Agent in Healthcare Call Centers</title><link>/blog/03-a-smart-decision-the-many-benefits-of-seahealth-voice-ai-agent-in-healthcare-call-centers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/03-a-smart-decision-the-many-benefits-of-seahealth-voice-ai-agent-in-healthcare-call-centers/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has become increasingly challenging for healthcare call centers to manage high volumes of incoming patient calls while also delivering high-quality care. Patients expect immediate responses, scheduling, and information, yet many call centers struggle with holding times and staff overwork. There is an urgent need for smarter and scalable solutions to address this demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike human agents, AI does not need to rest, so patients can receive support whenever they need it. AI can transform how patients communicate with a healthcare provider by using &lt;strong>AI-powered voice agents for healthcare,&lt;/strong> call centers are capable of scheduling appointments, providing assistance, and answering basic questions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
