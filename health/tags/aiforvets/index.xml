However, problems such as missed calls, and delayed responses result in frustrating the client and compromising pet care. The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard)">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> included in &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">SeaHealth&lt;/a> is an AI tool that takes the lead as a powerful solution, assisting vets to capture every single pet owner call, boosting efficiency without testing their patience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="https://devonshire-digital-marketing-agency.odoo.com/blog/our-blog-1/stop-losing-clients-to-missed-calls-a-guide-for-veterinary-clinics-65">Devonshire Digital Marketing Agency&lt;/a>, 80% of callers won’t leave voicemails and will eventually contact another clinic if their call is not picked up on time. AI technology lets vets finally stop doing tasks such as manually updating medical records and get to spend more time with furry patients, according to &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/artificial-intelligence-poised-transform-veterinary-care">AVMA&lt;/a>. According to &lt;a href="https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/veterinary-medicine-2025/">Veterinary Practice News&lt;/a>, their vets have reported increased client understanding and satisfaction after using AI-driven tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Reliable Communication Is Critical in Veterinary Care</title><link>/blog/39-why-reliable-communication-is-critical-in-veterinary-care/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/39-why-reliable-communication-is-critical-in-veterinary-care/</guid><description>&lt;p>Of all areas of animal medicine, communication perhaps plays the largest role as it acts as a tie between pet owners, vets, and staff. Since our scaly, furry, and feathered patients cannot tell us their symptoms, information transfer is essential to providing the best possible health. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> revolutionizes how this information passes through veterinary practices, ensuring nothing important is missed when pets’ well-being is at stake.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.harvardbusiness.org/good-leadership-it-all-starts-with-trust/?form=MG0AV3">Trust is at the core of good practice&lt;/a>. We’re talking open and transparent communication in diagnosis matters, treatment, and prognosis to build trust between you and your clients.
