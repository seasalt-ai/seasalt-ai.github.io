Well, with the increasing population, the need for help in assisted living centers is increasing day by day. According to the WHO, there will be more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1">two billion people aged over sixty by 2050&lt;/a>. This stat is almost twice as many as in 2020. One of the biggest challenges is having enough staff available to cater to residents.&lt;br>
Studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/us-has-hit-a-wall-reducing-worker-burnout-survey-finds.html">83% of workers in senior care facilities&lt;/a> suffer from burnout. This is primarily caused by overwork and negative staff-to-resident ratios. This severely impacts response time and quality of care. For overcoming this challenge, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a> provides continuous support in Assisted Living.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Never Miss a Patient Inquiry: SeaChat Voice AI's Role in Inbound Care</title><link>/blog/06-never-miss-a-patient-inquiry-seachat-voice-ais-role-in-inbound-care/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/06-never-miss-a-patient-inquiry-seachat-voice-ais-role-in-inbound-care/</guid><description>&lt;p>When patients call for appointments for medications or symptoms, they want immediate, straightforward answers. Unanswered calls and long wait times annoy patients and lead them to look for care elsewhere.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>SeaChat Voice AI for inbound healthcare inquiries&lt;/strong> is useful in this situation. It automatically answers calls and is intelligent. Smart call routing and 24/7 availability make sure no patient is left waiting.&lt;br>
Healthcare providers can use &lt;strong>AI-powered patient communication&lt;/strong> to improve patient satisfaction, reduce wait times, and decrease burdens while maintaining smooth and effective operations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
