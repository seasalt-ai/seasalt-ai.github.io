Today&amp;rsquo;s patients want calls replied to immediately together with simple appointment booking systems and understandable service information. Traditionally dental clinics have made use of their internal receptionists together with external call centers to manage patient inquiries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These operational solutions carry expensive costs which result in reduced operational effectiveness. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health/">SeaHealth&lt;/a> Voice AI technology provides affordable automated services that decrease operational phone calls and generate faster patient support responses and lower operational labor costs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Dental Clinics Can’t Afford to Miss a Call</title><link>/blog/14-why-dental-clinics-cant-afford-to-miss-a-call/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/14-why-dental-clinics-cant-afford-to-miss-a-call/</guid><description>&lt;p>The dental field is competitive. Patient satisfaction is the key to success. The ringing of a phone is not background noise. The patient is trying to make an appointment. If no one answers, they won’t wait. They will call a different clinic. It&amp;rsquo;s a lost trade. Dental clinics that use &lt;strong>AI call management for dental clinics&lt;/strong> eliminate this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every missed call delays treatment, annoys patients, or leaves a chair empty. Front desk teams handle calls, paperwork, and in-person visitors. It&amp;rsquo;s simple to ignore a call. &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>helps dental clinics reduce missed calls&lt;/strong> by answering, scheduling, and handling patient questions. Workers can focus on treating patients in the office.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
