&lt;p>The front desk of a busy veterinary clinic is the hub of daily operations, managing appointment scheduling, client inquiries, payment processing, and medical records. However, as patient volumes and administrative tasks continue to grow, reception staff often struggle to keep up, leading to longer wait times, missed calls, and potential revenue loss.&lt;/p>
