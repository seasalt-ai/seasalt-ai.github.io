Call handling by answering services has been the norm for a long time, but most of them are expensive, inconsistent, and have lag times during busy periods. Due to increasing pressures in long-term care, facilities need a better value communication system that is dependable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of technological improvements, &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/health">&lt;strong>SeaHealth&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>Voice AI&lt;/strong> is changing communication in long-term care by offering &lt;strong>cost benefits in residential care&lt;/strong> homes. Unlike regular answering services, AI-based solutions have automation, instant answer delivery, and &lt;a href="https://seasalt.ai/blog/98-inbound-answering-automated-system/">round-the-clock availability&lt;/a>. This means that caregivers, residents, and their families are not unduly delayed or neglected and get proper support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reducing Caregiver Burden: The Value of Voice AI in Senior Care</title><link>/blog/50-reducing-caregiver-burden-the-value-of-voice-ai-in-senior-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/50-reducing-caregiver-burden-the-value-of-voice-ai-in-senior-care/</guid><description>&lt;p>In an era where our populations are aging rapidly, demand for high-quality elder care is increasing exponentially. By 2050, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health">estimates suggest&lt;/a> that the proportion of people over 60 years old will approach doubling from 12% to 22%, now that this demographic is evolving. As with this demographic shift, another problem also shifts: caregiver burden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether health care providers or families, caregivers often face overwhelming physical, emotional, and financial burdens when caring for the elderly. Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">&lt;strong>SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> is on the rise as an invaluable tool to help professional caregivers and families more effectively provide more humane elder care. This shows &lt;strong>how Voice AI improves service and caregivers&amp;rsquo; satisfaction in elder care&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Providing Continuous Inbound Support: SeaChat Voice AI in Assisted Living</title><link>/blog/27-providing-continuous-inbound-support-seachat-voice-ai-in-assisted-living/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/27-providing-continuous-inbound-support-seachat-voice-ai-in-assisted-living/</guid><description>&lt;p>Are you familiar with using Voice AI in assisted living for providing continuous inbound support? Well, with the increasing population, the need for help in assisted living centers is increasing day by day. According to the WHO, there will be more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1">two billion people aged over sixty by 2050&lt;/a>. This stat is almost twice as many as in 2020. One of the biggest challenges is having enough staff available to cater to residents.&lt;br>
Studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/us-has-hit-a-wall-reducing-worker-burnout-survey-finds.html">83% of workers in senior care facilities&lt;/a> suffer from burnout. This is primarily caused by overwork and negative staff-to-resident ratios. This severely impacts response time and quality of care. For overcoming this challenge, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a> provides continuous support in Assisted Living.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Never Miss a Call in Residential Care: Leveraging the SeaMeet Dashboard</title><link>/blog/26-never-miss-a-call-in-residential-care-leveraging-the-seameet-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/26-never-miss-a-call-in-residential-care-leveraging-the-seameet-dashboard/</guid><description>&lt;p>Effective communication functions as the center of residential care facilities. Providing immediate answers to resident inquiries produces both positive resident satisfaction and the protection of their safety and overall well-being. Several residential facilities experience rising numbers of unanswered calls because their staffing shortages combine with problem-prone call systems and excessive workloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delayed response times result in resident frustration as well as deteriorating trust relationships and create risks to their health. The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> can be an effective solution. The system uses advanced analytical processes, which optimizes staff communication flow and rapid call response capabilities. Let’s explore how it works.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Communication Imperative: Why Every Call Counts in Hospitals &amp; Clinics</title><link>/blog/04-the-communication-imperative-why-every-call-counts-in-hospitals-clinics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/04-the-communication-imperative-why-every-call-counts-in-hospitals-clinics/</guid><description>&lt;p>In medicine every minute counts. Every call matters from a patient calling about a life-threatening emergency to a caregiver asking for a drug explanation. Satisfactorily meeting these needs could prove difficult given the growing burden on clinics and hospitals. In this sense &lt;strong>Healthcare Voice AI&lt;/strong> changes how doctors handle their correspondence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Healthcare surroundings depend on accessibility and reactivity. Regular contact patients either have appointments booked, seek quick treatment or clarify medical advice. Ignored or mismanaged calls can delay service, &lt;a href="https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/whats-keeping-healthcare-cios-up-at-night-how-to-improve-patient-satisfaction-by-handling-calls-more-efficiently/">disgruntled customers&lt;/a>, and tire out your staff members.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
