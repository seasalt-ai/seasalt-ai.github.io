Well, with the increasing population, the need for help in assisted living centers is increasing day by day. According to the WHO, there will be more than <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1">two billion people aged over sixty by 2050</a>. This stat is almost twice as many as in 2020. One of the biggest challenges is having enough staff available to cater to residents.<br>Studies show that <a href=https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/us-has-hit-a-wall-reducing-worker-burnout-survey-finds.html>83% of workers in senior care facilities</a> suffer from burnout. This is primarily caused by overwork and negative staff-to-resident ratios. This severely impacts response time and quality of care. For overcoming this challenge, <a href=https://chat.seasalt.ai/>SeaChat Voice AI</a> provides continuous support in Assisted Living.</p><p><img src=/health/images/blog/27-01.jpg alt></p><h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-in-traditional-assisted-living-support>What are the Challenges in Traditional Assisted Living Support?</h2><p>Assisted living facilities offer care to the elderly population, but like with every method of support, the traditional approaches have a few gaps:</p><h3 id=1-staff-ratio-gaps-and-work-overload>1. Staff Ratio Gaps and Work Overload</h3><ul><li>An additional 1.2 million senior care professionals will be required in America alone by 2030 to take care of the senior population.</li><li>Numerous facilities face a high turnover rate as well as challenges in recruiting new caregivers, causing them to lag in responding to resident needs.</li></ul><h3 id=2-ineffectiveness-in-responding-to-a-non-urgent-request>2. Ineffectiveness in Responding to a Non-Urgent Request</h3><ul><li>Not all requests made by residents can be characterized as top priorities. Still, oftentimes, their simple requests can go unattended for hours, which can greatly heighten anger levels and deteriorate the way they live.</li><li>According to a study led by the National Center for Assisted Living NCAL, more than 60% of the residents reported a desire to receive assistance quicker than they currently do.</li></ul><h3 id=3-trouble-in-conveying-information>3. Trouble in Conveying Information</h3><ul><li>Residents suffering from hearing or speech impairments are often unable to call or make simple requests for assistance, greatly impeding their ability to communicate.</li><li>There is often a lack of personalization when an average call button is installed, which can lead to misunderstandings and loss of property.</li></ul><h3 id=4-resource-delegation-and-caregiver-burnout>4. Resource Delegation and Caregiver Burnout</h3><ul><li>Since the majority of personnel are responsible for medical emergencies, non-guaranteed medical support, such as scheduling and maintenance assistance, usually gets left unattended.</li><li>Staff that are exhausted work around the clock, which can lead to dehumanizing interactions, which drastically decreases satisfaction levels.</li></ul><h2 id=seachat-voice-ai-transforms-assisted-living-support>SeaChat Voice AI Transforms Assisted Living Support</h2><p>To tackle the persistent issues of residents in assisted living facilities, AI solutions like SeaChat Voice AI are helping practitioners take care of residents more effectively. This Voice AI agent provides real-time help utilizing fuel information technology to provide paraprofessional support, helping seniors get assistance when needed and relieving stress from caregivers.</p><h3 id=does-seachat-voice-ai-provide-247-inbound-assistance>Does SeaChat Voice AI Provide 24/7 Inbound Assistance?</h3><p>Unlike traditional call systems, you would have SeaChat Voice AI availability 24 hours a day. Users can easily order room service, book appointments or inquire about their medication schedule.</p><h3 id=how-can-seachat-voice-ai-reduce-staff-burden>How Can Seachat Voice AI Reduce Staff Burden?</h3><p>Because many non-critical inquiries and routine questions can be automated, caregivers can maximize their attention to critical patient needs and not waste precious time on trivial matters. According to a McKinsey & Company study, up to 30% of administrative tasks in the <a href=https://seasalt.ai/blog/61-seachat-voice-ai-agent-in-healthcare/>healthcare sector</a> could be alleviated through AI, resulting in staff spending more time on tasks that matter.</p><h3 id=can-it-provide-personalized-interaction>Can It Provide Personalized Interaction?</h3><p>Resident history, preferences, and medical requirements help SeaChat Voice AI determine which responses will be the most effective. This kind of tailoring ensures a senior-appropriate conversation that assists in putting them at ease with the technology.</p><h2 id=key-features-of-seachat-voice-ai-in-assisted-living>Key Features of SeaChat Voice AI in Assisted Living</h2><p>Embedding Sea-Chat Voice AI in assisted living facilities improves the residents&rsquo; experience and operational efficiency.</p><h3 id=how-does-seachat-voice-ai-activate-emergency-and-non-emergency-requests>How Does Seachat Voice AI Activate Emergency and Non-Emergency Requests?</h3><p>Speech recognition is a very effective way of requesting help for emergencies and non-emergencies. In these call cases, the mobility to make the request and wait for staff intervention is no longer useful. For those who have speech and mobility challenges, systems like these are very beneficial.</p><h3 id=can-it-remind-residents-to-take-medication-and-check-on-their-wellbeing>Can it Remind Residents to Take Medication and Check on Their Wellbeing?</h3><p>Non-compliance with taking medication is one of the major reasons behind 125,000 deaths, as cited in <a href=https://www.ama-assn.org/education/improve-gme/teaching-residents-what-do-when-patients-don-t-take-their-meds>research</a> by the Journal of the American Medical Association. Sea-Chat Voice AI can play an important role for residents, so they don&rsquo;t miss their scheduled dosages by issuing reminders.</p><h3 id=will-it-link-with-facility-management>Will it Link with Facility Management?</h3><p>These residents can issue a voice complaint about maintenance, housekeeping, and even meal preferences, and as a result, tardiness in facility service delivery is greatly reduced.</p><h3 id=can-it-support-more-than-one-language>Can it Support More Than One Language?</h3><p>Due to the multicultural nature of assisted communities, which exploit various culture-responsive care models, Sea-Chat Voice AI has multilingual options so residents and caregivers can communicate without language hindrance.</p><h2 id=seachat-voice-ai-improves-resident-experience-and-safety>SeaChat Voice AI Improves Resident Experience and Safety.</h2><p>AI solutions like Sea-Chat Voice have revolutionized how seniors would interact with technology, and these benefits include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Reduced waiting times to obtain the basic needed assistance.</li><li>The ability to independently make requests is not usually permitted without a caregiver&rsquo;s permission.</li><li>Improved communication: Family members can receive AI-powered updates and reminders.</li></ul><h2 id=implementation-and-adoption-of-seachat-voice-ai>Implementation and Adoption of SeaChat Voice AI</h2><p>The adoption of AI in assisted living facilities is carried out in the following steps:</p><ul><li>Easy incorporation with current communication facilities.</li><li>Orientation sessions for the staff and residents to facilitate change.</li><li>Managing information security risks to comply with HIPAA and other regulations.</li></ul><p><img src=/health/images/blog/27-02.jpg alt></p><h2 id=the-future-of-ai-in-assisted-living>The Future of AI in Assisted Living</h2><p>With the adoption of AI technology, the future of Voice AI seems to be booming. In the future, there will be:</p><ul><li>Warning signals to identify potential health issues of seniors in advance.</li><li>AI that provides senior companionship features to minimize isolation.</li><li>Voice AI that interfaces with smart home appliances for more comprehensive elder care.</li></ul><p>With SeaChat Voice AI, assisted living facilities can provide continuous, dependable, and moderate care. In addition, staff burdens for documentation, communication, and responsiveness are virtually eliminated, enhancing the level of care provided.
