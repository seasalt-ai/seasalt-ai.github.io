Well, with the increasing population, the need for help in assisted living centers is increasing day by day. According to the WHO, there will be more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1">two billion people aged over sixty by 2050&lt;/a>. This stat is almost twice as many as in 2020. One of the biggest challenges is having enough staff available to cater to residents.&lt;br>
Studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/us-has-hit-a-wall-reducing-worker-burnout-survey-finds.html">83% of workers in senior care facilities&lt;/a> suffer from burnout. This is primarily caused by overwork and negative staff-to-resident ratios. This severely impacts response time and quality of care. For overcoming this challenge, &lt;a href="https://chat.seasalt.ai/">SeaChat Voice AI&lt;/a> provides continuous support in Assisted Living.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Never Miss a Call in Residential Care: Leveraging the SeaMeet Dashboard</title><link>/blog/26-never-miss-a-call-in-residential-care-leveraging-the-seameet-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/26-never-miss-a-call-in-residential-care-leveraging-the-seameet-dashboard/</guid><description>&lt;p>Effective communication functions as the center of residential care facilities. Providing immediate answers to resident inquiries produces both positive resident satisfaction and the protection of their safety and overall well-being. Several residential facilities experience rising numbers of unanswered calls because their staffing shortages combine with problem-prone call systems and excessive workloads.&lt;/p>

The &lt;a href="https://usecase.seasalt.ai/hospital-phone-call-analytics-dashboard">&lt;strong>SeaMeet Dashboard&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> can be an effective solution. The system uses advanced analytical processes, which optimizes staff communication flow and rapid call response capabilities.

When you have effective flow of information among caregivers, residents and facilities, clinical outcomes are significantly impacted. But when communication is poor, outcomes are anywhere between the inconsequential to the fatal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LTC facilities are plagued with communication problems unlike those found in other healthcare dispensations. With 24-hour care requirements, diverse resident identities, and intricate care needs, your facility navigates a communication landscape full of potential pitfalls. New technologies such as &lt;strong>SeaHealth Voice AI&lt;/strong> are only just beginning to appear to confront your potential problems head-on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
