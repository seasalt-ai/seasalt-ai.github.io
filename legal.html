  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Service Components that include “API” in
their names are referred to in this Agreement as “APIs”. Service Components
that include “Model Builder” in their names are referred to in this Agreement
as “Model Builders”.</p>

is not primarily a substitute for one or more Service Components&nbsp;("Application") may, subject to the
terms of this Agreement and subject to Seasalt.ai granting you access to the
applicable Service Components, interact with the APIs.</p>

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><b>This Agreement includes important obligations

Agreement:&nbsp;“Data” means all data,
including all text, audio, images (including video), and software, that are
provided to Seasalt.ai by you or your Application (including on behalf of End
Users), through the Service Components; and "End User" means you, any
person you permit to access data hosted in the Service Components or otherwise
use the Service Components, and any user of your Application.</p>

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">You agree to subscribe to the APIs you use by
way of the Seasalt.ai subscription service provided by Seasalt.ai for that purpose
(“the Marketplace Service”).</p>

Agreement on the relevant API's webpage of the Marketplace Service (the “API
Webpage”).</p>

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Seasalt.ai may update this Agreement by posting
new terms and conditions on this page. The new terms and conditions will
automatically take effect and apply to your use of the Service Components after
30 days from posting. If you do not accept the new terms and conditions, you
must stop using the Service Components within the 30-day period from the posting
of the new terms and conditions. Your use of certain elements of the Service
Components may be subject to additional guidelines, posted notices, codes of
conduct, or the terms for the applicable Marketplace Service. These are
incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

may pursue all legal remedies for use of the Service Components in violation of
this Agreement. No license is granted herein to resell, create derivative works,
reverse engineer, repackage, or modify the Services.
  </p>

  <p>Seasalt.ai may modify or discontinue any of its Service Components or the

material changes to the Service Components or changes to this Agreement by
posting such changes at Seasalt.ai's websites which shall be your sole notice of

in and to such Aggregate Data and output data, including all intellectual
property rights therein. You also hereby grant each user of the Service

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><b>Section 27 - Payment</b></p>

  <p>The fees, if any, for using Seasalt.ai's Service Components are set forth on
Seasalt.ai's websites which may be modified by Seasalt.ai. Continued use of the
Service Components and the non-termination of your account with Seasalt.ai after
fee changes are posted to the website constitutes your acceptance of the prices
as modified. You agree to pay all fees fully and promptly.
  </p>

  <p>The fees, if any, for the Service Components must be paid in advance. The
credit card information provided to Seasalt.ai or a third party payment processor
to pay for the Service Components shall be automatically charged for the
Service Components upon renewal. In the event that Seasalt.ai or a third party
payment processor is unable to bill the credit card on file or you request that
Seasalt.ai not bill the credit card, you shall be solely responsible for any
renewal payment required. In the event that payment is not made, Service
Components may become unavailable to you and Seasalt.ai may terminate this
Agreement without notice to you.
  </p>

  <p>If any charges are rejected by your credit card issuer then Seasalt.ai may
deactivate your account until payment is successfully received. Seasalt.ai may
deactivate any account that has a disputed charge until Seasalt.ai, in its sole
discretion, determines the dispute resolved.
  </p>

  <p>You must provide Seasalt.ai notice of any billing problems or disputes within
sixty (60) days after they first appear on the statement you receive from your
bank, credit card company, or other billing company. Failure to notify Seasalt.ai
of the problem within the sixty (60) day period will result in your acceptance
of the charges and you waive the right to dispute such problems or
discrepancies. Failure to use your account will not be deemed a basis for
refusing to pay any charges. Seasalt.ai does not provide any refunds for any
Service Components.
