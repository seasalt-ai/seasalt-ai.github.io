## Section 1 - Description

Service Components that include “API” in their names are referred to in this Agreement as “APIs”. Service Components that include “Model Builder” in their names are referred to in this Agreement as “Model Builders”.

This Agreement includes important obligations related to privacy, End Users, and Data in sections 4-8. Your software application that adds primary and significant functionality to APIs and that is not primarily a substitute for one or more Service Components (“Application”) may, subject to the terms of this Agreement and subject to Seasalt.ai granting you access to the applicable Service Components, interact with the APIs.

Please read them carefully. In this Agreement: “Data” means all data, including all text, audio, and images (including video), that are provided to Seasalt.ai by you or any other user of the Seasalt.ai software.

You agree to subscribe to the APIs you use by way of the Seasalt.ai subscription service provided by Seasalt.ai for that purpose (“the Marketplace Service”).

## Section 2 – Acceptance of Terms

This Agreement is a contract between you and the Seasalt.ai company.

You can view the most current version of this Agreement on the relevant API\'s webpage of the Marketplace Service (the “API Webpage”).

Seasalt.ai may update this Agreement by posting new terms and conditions on this page. The new terms and conditions will automatically take effect and apply to your use of the Service Components after 30 days from posting. If you do not accept the new terms and conditions, you must stop using the Service Components within the 30-day period from the posting of the new terms and conditions. Your use of certain elements of the Service Components may be subject to additional guidelines, posted notices, codes of conduct, or the terms for the applicable Marketplace Service. These are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

By creating an account or accepting this Agreement, you represent that you are at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority where you live, if that is more than 18 years of age. If you are under 18 or have not reached such age of majority, your parent or legal guardian must set up an account on your behalf and accept this Agreement.

The Service Components are intended to function as described in the associated documentation, but please note that the Service Components are a preview and that Seasalt.ai does not provide warranties or a service level agreement for the Service Components. Please read them carefully.

## Section 3 - License

During the term of your subscription and subject to your compliance with this Agreement (and only if Seasalt.ai has granted you access to the applicable Service Component), Seasalt.ai provides you a non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to:

*   use Seasalt.ai products to build models to deploy as corresponding APIs;
*   transmit data to, and receive results from, the APIs, limited solely to your own use within your Application;

For web pages, you will display attribution in a reasonably accessible page footer or other similarly prominent location. Attribution should read “powered by Seasalt.ai” and provide a hyperlink to the Seasalt.ai website at https://seasalt.ai/privacy
